  - In this asset of Power BI and Excel, Calculate EVM by comparing Requirement(Backlog) and Task.
 - **Original Estimate** of Requirement(Backlog) is set.
 - Team member can add task as child of Requirement(Backlog). They set **Original Estimate**, **Remaining Work** and **Completed work**.  If you do work you will reduce **Remaining Work**. Also increase **Completed work**.
  - Change the **State** of task and Requirement(Backlog) to **Closed**.
  - The report is intended to be created for each iteration period. The SPI and the PV are not correct when making it on the way.

1. Open the Excel file and input **1.2. Iteration Data** work sheet. Change ＊＊Spent** of the past iteration  to **TRUE**.
1. Open the query via Visual Studio. Export Work items of VSTS to Excel file by using **Open by Excel**  command.

1. Paste it to **3. Exported TFS・VSTS Data** work sheet of the Itearation Excel file. The hierarchy of exported work items may not go well. In that case, please give feedback.
1. Change **Data Date** of all rows.
1. Select all of table data and copy it.
1. Open the Data Source Excel file and paste Iteration data to the end of the file as text. If the expression remains, the report is incorrect.
