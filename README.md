Without using this asset, we can see "now" via using VSTS/TFS and Power BI.
However, because there is no history, we can not make the EVM report. 

You can create a history, which is data soruce of EVM, by creating an Excel file with the templates contained in this asset. Then use the Power BI report template to create a report.
This feature wants to be VSTS extension in the near future. But now I need to make the file manually.
