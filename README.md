## Background
We should develop by agile. But if it is not possible, we have no choice but to develop by traditional development methods. This asset makes it easy for developers to make traditional reports, even if they use the latest VSTS.

Without using this asset, we can see "now" via using VSTS/TFS and Power BI.
However, because there is no history, we can not make the EVM report. 

You can create a history, which is data soruce of EVM, by creating an Excel file with the templates contained in this asset. Then use the Power BI report template to create a report.
This feature wants to be VSTS extension in the near future. But now I need to make the file manually.
